# space-shooter

Choose your weapon and shoot space aliens in your spaceship

# How to start

npm i && npm start

# Ideas

- Credits System
  - Each upgrade costs set amount of credits
- Revamp shot modifiers
- Longer projectiles that look cool but don't have additional power
- Faster pace like videoball
- Concept of waves of enemies
- More satisfying explosions
- screen shake on death (with audio then transition to death screen)

# Longer term

Display damage numbers
Hotkeys to switch between weapons
Rotating asteroids
Non-circle projectiles
Mouse movement
Shield
Twin ships
Terrain that is collidable
Reduce fire rate when space bar held down
Progression system

- Like Life-force?
- Exp system
- Level up screen
- Loot drops from enemies
- Loot magnet

Dynamic difficulty

- target survival time of 1 min
- if over x games, user averages a longer survival time, bump up enemy health and speed
